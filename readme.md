# Security project

 This project is created to give you some examples how web application can have security flaws.
 
 ### Why we are doing this?
Nowadays clients are more and more in the mind that manual testers should have some experience in security testing. We are trying to spread the word and find new security enthusiasts

### What can be done with this?
Right now we have created application which will teach you the basics about three points.
We are hoping to get some attention with it and develop more of those web applications (mobile applications as well in the future).
In the first project you will find:
- Session management flaws
- Malicious input flaws
- Business logic flaws
- ... and possibily more that we didn't plan to keep
